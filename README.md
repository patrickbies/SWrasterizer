# SWrasterizer
Software Rasterization project for online CS50 course

#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/gnM1rS3B5dk
#### Description:
This project is a software rasterizer written in C++. 
It contains vertex interpolation, flat shading, smooth shading, normal mapping, albedo texture mapping, 
diffuse light, ambient light, specular light. Handmade linear algebra class, triangle rasterization using
barycentric coordinates, + much more. 

##### FYI:
I began this project with no prior C++ experience so the code is quite messy. 

##### Controls: 

WASD SPACE and SHIFT control camera movement.
The arrow keys control camera rotation.

POIJKL Control the lighting rotation and movement.
TGFHYU control the rotation of objects in the scene.
